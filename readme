## Project Description

This project simulates a customer support dataset with:
- 30,000 synthetic customers
- Realistic support ticket texts generated using OpenAI GPT
- Sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative)
- Urgency detection (urgent vs non-urgent)
- Structured customer attributes (age, plan, monthly usage)

**Key Analysis Done:**
- Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
- Cox Proportional Hazards Modeling
- Churn Rate vs Monthly Usage
- Risk Table of Customers
- Age vs churn
- Frequency of complaints
- Sentiment vs Survival

## Final Deliverables
- **Tableau Dashboard** showing:
  - KPIs (Total Customers, Churn Rate, Avg Survival, % Urgent)
  - Urgency Pie Chart
  - Sentiment Bar Chart
  - Smooth pie Chart (Monthly Usage vs Churn)
  - Frequency of complaints & Age vs churn
- **Fully interactive filters**: Sentiment, Urgency, Subscription Plan

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, TextBlob, Lifelines)
- **Tableau Public** (Dashboard visualization)
- **OpenAI GPT API** (for text generation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for survival analysis)
